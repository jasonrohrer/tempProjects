<H1>DonationTracker v0.1</H1>


DonationTracker is a Perl CGI script for tracking live PayPal donation tallies using IPN (PayPal's Instant Payment Notification service).
This tool was developed to help creators make a living post-copyright (as described in my essay, <A HREF="http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/freeDistribution.html">Free Distribution</A>), but others may find it useful as well.<BR>
<BR>
This script does not do anything much except track donations.
Its flashiest feature is the generation of live, PNG-format graphs for the current month's donation history.
An example of this script in action can be found on the <A HREF="http://mute-net.sf.net">MUTE project website</A>.<BR>

Brief installation instructions are included.
Some non-standard modules (GD and GD:Graph---for graphing) are included.

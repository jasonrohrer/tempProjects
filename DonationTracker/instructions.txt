Installing:

1.  Copy the contents of this distribution into your cgi-bin directory.

2.  Give the various .pl scripts proper permissions to be executable
    by your web server. 
    (maybe with  chmod a+x donationTracker.pl )

2.  Make a directory at the same level as cgi-bin called "cgi-data".

3.  Create a directory in cgi-data called "donationTracker".  This is 
    where private data, such as the donation log, will be stored.

4.  Make sure that cgi-data/donationTracker is writable by the scripts
    so that the scripts can create files in that directory.
    (maybe with  chmod a+w cgi-data/donationTracker )

5.  Create a directory inside your public html directory called "donationData".
    This is where the scripts will store public data that will be served
    on the web.

6.  Make sure your donationData directory is writable by the script.
    (maybe with  chmod a+w donationData )

7.  Copy the HTML from tracker.shtml into your web page.
    Note that the tracker HTML relies on server-side includes to grab
    the latest donation count and sum from static HTML files in the 
    donationData directory.  If you are using PHP for your site,
    there may be a different way to inline these files.  


Configuring:

1.  Edit the settings at the top of the donationTracker.pl, 
    donationGrapher.pl, and graphGrabber.pl scripts as needed.
    Look for "changeMe" and insert appropriate values.

2.  Edit the fields in the PayPal form that you copied from the tracker.shtml 
    file.  Look for "changeMe" and insert appropriate values.
    Also edit the "changeMe" in the URL for the graphGrabber script.

3.  Make sure IPN is enabled on your PayPal account.



How it works:

Whenever a donation is made through PayPal, their IPN service "pings" your
donationTracker.pl script, passing it the various data values associated with 
the donation.  The script saves information about the donations, tracking
the donation count and overall sum, along with daily sub-totals (for graphing).

If graphing is enabled, the donationGrapher.pl script is called by the 
donationTracker each time a donation is received.  The grapher turns the
latest daily sub-totals into a graph of the current month's activity.

But what happens if no donations come in for a few days?  Since the 
donationTracker would not be called by PayPal, the graph would not be updated,
and it would fall behind the current date (when it should actually show a
"plateau" in the donation plot).  This is where graphGrabber.pl comes it.
Instead of pointing to the graph image files directly, the tracker.shtml HTML
points to the graphGrabber.  This script checks the modification times on
the image files to ensure that they have been updated at least one time today.
If not, it calls donationGrapher to force the graphs to be updated.  The 
graphGrabber then redirects the browser to the image files directly.

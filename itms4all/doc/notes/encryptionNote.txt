Last year you had a blog entry about Apple encrypting the iTunes Music Store.
I didn't see any follow ups on this, so I don't know if anyone cares anymore, but I've figured out the encryption.

The encryption is standard AES128 CBC. The iv, of course, is sent in the header, and the encryption key is:

8a 9d ad 39 9f b0 14 c1 31 be 61 18 20 d7 88 95

After decrypting, you'll end up with a gzip file.

The key is actually generated from the following code snippet:
(using openssl's md5)
MD5_CTX ctx
unsigned char key[16];
MD5_Init(&ctx);
MD5_Update(&ctx,"Accept-Language",15);
MD5_Update(&ctx,"user-agent",10);
MD5_Update(&ctx,"max-age",7);
MD5_Final(key,&ctx);
// key[16] contains the AES key now

Hope this helps revive everyone's ITMS interfaces.

Search the iTunes Music Store from Anywhere

After a few days of intense protocol sniffing and reverse engineering, I've figured out how to interact with Apple's iTMS server.  Decrypting Apple's responses (which are encrypted with AES-128) was the hurdle that tripped [previous efforts] in this direction.  I have a [Perl CGI script running] that you can use to search the Store from any browser (even on a cell phone).  You can access the entire library of free preview clips, which can be played on GNU/Linux using [VLC].  I have written [notes] about the protocol, and you can [download] the script to run it on your own server.  This is a small step toward the goal of easy access to iTMS's massive database of meta-data, cover images, and preview clips.  Imagine if your favorite p2p app could fetch a 30-second preview of a song before you even started downloading the file...

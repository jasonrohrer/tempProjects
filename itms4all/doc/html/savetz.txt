TunesTracker does still work. I'm still decoding with rijndael-128. Although
I did make many changes to the original iTMS code, I don't think I changed
anything specifically when 4.7 came out, although I do recall finding and
fixing some problems with your code (or whoever wrote the PHP that I started
from) around the eregi commands - maybe those changes make the difference.

Here's the business end of my PHP code:

$url = 
"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?no
nameSubmitButton=submit&songTerm=&composerTerm=&albumTerm=&artistTerm=" .
urlencode($searchterm). "&genreIndex=1";  //searching artist

$ch=curl_init($url);
     curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1);
     curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
     curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 9);
     curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "iTunes/4.2 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac
OS X 10.2)");

$iTunesKeyHex = "8a9dad399fb014c131be611820d78895";
$iTunesKey = pack ("H*", $iTunesKeyHex);

$result=curl_exec ($ch);
curl_close ($ch);

eregi("Content-Length: (.[0-9-]+)", $result, $hvalue[0]);
eregi("x-apple-crypto-iv: (.[a-z0-9-]+)", $result, $hvalue[1]);

$contentLength = $hvalue[0][1];
$ivHex = $hvalue[1][1];
$encryptedSearchResults = substr( $result, strlen( $result ) -
$contentLength );
$iv = pack( "H*", $ivHex );

/* Open the cipher */
$td = mcrypt_module_open('rijndael-128', '', 'cbc', '');
/* Initialize encryption module for decryption */
mcrypt_generic_init($td, $iTunesKey, $iv);
/* Decrypt encrypted string */
$decryptedSearchResultsGZIP = mdecrypt_generic($td,
$encryptedSearchResults);
/* Terminate decryption handle and close module */
mcrypt_generic_deinit($td);
mcrypt_module_close($td);
$tempFileName = tempnam('/tmp','tt');

$out = fopen($tempFileName, "w");
fwrite($out, trim($decryptedSearchResultsGZIP));
fclose($out);

//uncompress
$zd = gzopen($tempFileName, "r");
$rawData = gzread($zd, $contentLength*1024);
gzclose($zd);
unlink($tempFileName);



Let me know how it goes.
-Kevin

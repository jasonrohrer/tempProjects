94-byte setup message sent from host to tourbox

bytes 4 through 92 (even bytes only) set haptics and fire speed for each knob/dial/scroll, where each one can be modified by holding down a button while turning.  Buttons include holding down each knob/dial/scroll.  For example:

Knob
Knob + side
Knob + top
Knob + tall
Knob + short
Knob + up
Knob + down
Knob + left
Knob + right
Knob + tour
Knob + c1
Knob + c2
Knob + pressed Knob
Knob + pressed Scroll
Knob + pressed Dial

15 slots per knob/dial/scroll = 45 slots total

The order that these slots are mapped is arbitrary and a bit strange.
The mapping is shown in the Gnumeric spread sheet.


The bytes are set as follows

00000000 Haptics Off, Rotation Fast
00000100 Haptics Weak, Rotation Fast
00001000 Haptics Strong, Rotation Fast
00000001 Haptics Off, Rotation Medium
00000010 Haptics Off, Rotation Slow

These can be OR'd together to achieve different combinations of haptics and
rotational trigger speed.

I.e., bottom two bits control rotation trigger speed, top two bits control
haptics strength.

And if you set top two bits to 11, it turns haptics off.
If you set bottom two bits to 11, it turns rotational triggering off completely.

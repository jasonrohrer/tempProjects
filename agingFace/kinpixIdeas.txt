                 

Here are some ideas


Top page


                  k i n p i x

             
             You are invited to the family
           album of the internet

           Let's see how good you are at
           recognizing fellow kin

           We will present you with a baby face
           and four pixs of grownups

           One of them is their mom or dad

           Klick and see whether you are right


Buttons on this page (numbers are only there so that I later
expand on each button).
Same rack of buttons should be on all pages!

1) play round
2) login 
3) why login?
4) add immage pair
5) why this game
6) about us
7) rational for ratings
8) confidentiality

Subpage 1)

When you click play round then you immediately are thrown into
the first round

"next round (any key)" has to be easily accessable

Alternate: A shrunken version of current pixs with
ralationship appears on top right and the next round
is immediately displayed after you choose

If they want to see the previous pixs in large again
they can use the back button

The read corners around the baby and parent are not strong enough
Suggestion: Drop the three other pics to a slightly lower level
and move the parent up (closer to baby)

Subpage 2)
Login is useful if you want to see how good you are
compared to other netizens

Name and password should be easily to remember

We collect some basic info (voluntary) so that
we can see whether grandma's are really better
at this game

Subpage 3)

 Make up any name (that you can remember easily)!

 We will keep tallies so that you can compare your skill 
against uncle Joe and grandma Ottilie

 The password keeps others from using your name

 Show a little sample picture of BABY image
and PARENTT image
 Use the term baby and parent

Subpage 5)

 We want to create a game that is fun for all age groups
and not just for "adults"

 Our background is in the design of "learning algorithms".
So the task is to find methods that will automatically present 
each parent with similar looking decoys. 
In other words we are trying to make the game challenging 
for the you
We have to do this based on history of each picture
in the game

To be filled in

Subpage 8: We will not use your picture for any purpose
and will keep info about sex and age confidential.
We might publish papers about
the ratings schemes, etc, in academic journals.

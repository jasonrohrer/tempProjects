<!--Description Text-->
<FONT COLOR=#000000>
Some <A HREF="http://www.hotornot.com">existing web games</A> are appealing mainly to adult males.  We wanted to create a game that is appealing to everyone, and we feel that kinship face matching fits the bill: we as humans seem to enjoy this activity.<BR><BR>  

Our background is in the design of learning algorithms, so we are interested in finding methods that will automatically select the best decoy parent faces for a given baby face.  As we learn the best decoys, the game will become more challenging for the players.

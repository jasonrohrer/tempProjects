Thinking about the object parameter mapping.

Each mapping is specified by a series of control points in the [0,1] space.
The [0,1] parameter is used to linearly mix these control points.


Each control point has the following elements:

--parameterAnchor
--numPolygonVertices
--XY values for each vertex
--RGBA fill color for each vertex
--RGBA border color for each vertex
--Border line width
--numRotatedCopies (number of copies of base vertices to draw at evenly spaced
                    angles to create a "flower" effect)                    
--rotationRate (rotations per second, positive for clockwise, negative for ccw)

RGBA can be a color name from the color folder


Two sample control points for a ship:

1.0
3
0 1
shipNoseColor clearColor 0
-1 -1
shipWingForwardColor clearColor 0
1 -1
shipWingForwardColor clearColor 0
0
0


0
3
0 1
shipNoseColor clearColor 0
-1 -1
shipWingBackwardColor clearColor 0
1 -1
shipWingBackwardColor clearColor 0
0
0


Code for dealing with this:


DrawableObject class:
--Can draw itself into the current GL context
--Draw function takes a scale factor, a rotation, and an offset vector

ParameterizedObject class:
--Can read a parameterized object from a file.
--Can map a [0,1] parameter to a DrawableObject



Added DrawableObject and changed game to create 50 test objects... they work.
Checked for memory leaks.

Next:
Use gprof to look for hotspots in code
write ParameterizedObject

How to blend two vertext sets that have different numbers of vertices?

Each vertex in the larger set needs to pick its "closest" vertex
in the smaller set and blend toward that vertex.  Thus, we may have
two vertices from the larger set that are both approaching one vertex
from the smaller set.

Space the vertices from both sets out evenly, in order, with an
extra parameter in the range [0,1].  For example, if we have 3 vertices,
they will be assigned this etra parameter as follows:

0.0  vertex 0
0.5  vertex 1
1.0  vertex 2

If our other set has 5 vertices, the assignment would be as follows:

0.0  vertex 0
0.25 vertex 1
0.5  vertex 2
0.75 vertex 3
1.0  vertex 4

In this case, vertices 2 and 4 from the larger set would blend with
vertices 1 and 5 from the smaller set, respectively.

Actually, the easiest way to achieve this would be to convert the
vertex index number of the larger set into a floating point value
in the index range of the smaller set and then round these numbers
to integer indices.

For example, if x is an index in our 5-vertex set, the we would
find its partner in the 3-vertex set with:

rint( ( (double)x / 4.0 ) * 2.0 )



This code works well, and it produces a nice effect.

However, having the base object be one polygon seems limiting... 
Could there be a way to specify "break points" in the vertex list
to break the list into multiple polygons?

How would we blend between two such points?  How could we avoid "popping"
as a vertex becomes part of another polygon during one of these blends?

Maybe it doesn't matter... maybe single polygons are good enough...
after all, a polygon can be quite complicated.

But what if graphics cards don't draw polygongs as fast as they draw
triangles?  This could be true...

Develop for now with only one polygon at each control point... use
rotated copies to achieve more complex effects, for now.

Checked for memory leaks (and fixed one).


Next:
Write code to read control point in from file.

Idea for bullet powerups:

Bullets have a 3-parameter power space (similar to RGB), with each
parameter in the range [0,1].

For each level, we define 3 object spaces for bullets.  The 3-parameter
power up space is used to select 3 objects (one from each object space).

Those three objects are combined (overlapped, or maybe chained?) to make
a bullet.  Maybe those 3 objects could even be blended over the course
of the bullet's life (close range, bullet looks like object 0, then
farther out, it blends toward object 1, and finally toward object 2).

The power of the bullet can be equal to the sum of the 3 parameters (or, if
doing the range blend, the bullet's power can change over its range smoothly
through each parameter level).

How sculputure pieces affect bullet powerups:

We define a space of object control points for sculpture pieces.
That space also includes an extra space of 3-parameter bullet control
points.  For example, a sculputure piece might map into the bullet powerup
space as:

0.05, 0.0, 0.1

Thus, it would add this much to the current bullet parameters if it were
added to the sculpture.

How to reward sculpture symmetry:

The environment will start out with a sculpture base that pieces will need
to touch initially to become part of the sculpture.

We can compute the "center of mass" of the sculpture by averaging the positions
of all of the pieces.  Then, we can compute the distance from this mass center
to the sculpture base.  We can then scale the power of the bullets inversly by
 this distance, maybe scaling bullet size to show the changes in power.

Once the bullet parameters reach 1, 1, 1 (and with a relatively symmetrical
sculpture), the bullets should be strong enough to defeat the boss in a few
shots.  Higher levels can be made harder with the following factors:

--Sculputure pieces upgrade bullets by a smaller amount
--More enemies
--Boss fires more


Ship damage idea:
Always draw a teather line back to the sculpture center (can change color
depending on current bullet powerup... maybe with RGB and then width according
to bullet power).

When ship is hit by enemy/boss bullets, ship is pulled back toward sculputure
center, bit by bit, depending on bullet strength.  No death for ship, but being
pushed away from boss makes it hard to shoot/destroy boss.

Enemies try to shoot both ship and sculpture pieces (sculpture pieces can
be destroyed... or maybe just dislodged from sculpture).


Boss idea:
Define an object control point space for each boss.  Map into that space
with 1 when the boss is at full health and 0 when the boss is about to die
(so as you shoot the boss, it gradually changes form).

Boss fires faster and faster as it approaches death.

All bullets in the game

Explosion idea:
Each level defines two explosion control point spaces (boss explosion and 
general enemy explosion)

Map from 0 to 1 gradually in an explosion space to animate the explosion. 



Got it to compile on Mac OS X (after adding missing glutInit call).  Good.


Wrote code to read control points from file.
Added test code to game.
Checked for memory leaks.


Next:
write ParameterizedObject




June 15, 2004

Got ParameterizedObject fully working and wrote test code in game.cpp.

Tested for memory leaks.


Next:

Start working on a Bullet class.

Changing it a bit:
A bullet has 2 parameters:

First parameter controls bullet's form/power at close range
Second parameter controls form/power at distant range.


Ship bullet settings read from a file.
File contains two strings (names of the 2 object parameter space files).


Finished ship bullet class.

Need to add code to game to test it... maybe some class to manage the bullets?



June 16, 2004

Wrote a ShipBulletManager... for some reason, only one bullet fires at a time
in game.cpp test code.  More testing needed.


June 18, 2004

Fixed bug in ShipBulletManager and added proper test code to game.cpp

Tested for memory leaks.


Turning wrapping off should result in a 9-fold framerate increase.  Worth
it for now until more intelligent wrapping is coded... if ever.  Better
wrapping would only show visible copies of world.

Idea:
Each object can include a "max radius estimate" that the object designer
provides.  This can be used to avoid drawing objects that are off the screen.

Still need to figure out how to determine what is on the screen.


Next:
Start working on enemies


EnemyManager:
--Called to draw enemies for each frame.
--Controls enemy behavior (in a passTime function)
--Tests enemies for collisions with ship bullets and activates explosion
  animations.


Explosions are working.



Next:
--Check for memory leaks
--Add code to enemy manager to fade out last frame of explosion animation
  for a bit of extra time before destroying enemy
  (Maybe something similar for bullet manager).


Checked for (and fixed) memory leaks.

Problem:
GL_POLYGONs cannot be concave.
Impossible to avoid concave polygons in the general case when blending shapes,
even when the end-point shapes are convex.

Better:
Each object is comprised of a line-loop (border) and series of triangles.
Vertex arrays can be the same as before, except they must now have lengths
that are multiples of 3 so that they can be interpreted as triangles

There must be a separate array for the border.

Also, the border vertices can be used for collision detection.

Vertex blending code can remain the same...


New format for a control point:

--parameterAnchor
--numTriangleVertices  (must be multiple of 3... vertex list truncated if not
                        a multiple of 3)
--XY values for each vertex
--RGBA fill color for each triangle vertex

--numBorderVertices
--XY values for each border vertex
--RGBA border color for each border vertex
--Border line width

--numRotatedCopies (number of copies of base vertices to draw at evenly spaced
                    angles to create a "flower" effect)                    
--rotationRate (rotations per second, positive for clockwise, negative for ccw)

RGBA can be a color name from the color folder



June 19, 2004

Changed to use new format for control points (separate border and triangles).

Fixed ship and bullets to match format.

Still need to fix enemy files.



June 20, 2004

Fixed enemy files to match new format.... it's a lot of work.

To make blending work (i.e., not look weird), all control points need to have 
the same number of triangles.  Not as nice as general polygon blending...
wish there was a way around this issue.

Eventually, should make a GL-based editor for DrawableObjects... can be 
keyboard controled (one key cycles through vertices, and other keys modify
the current vertex in various ways).


Now we can use border vertices for collision detection...

Can compute enemy center by taking weighted average of all border vertices.
Can compute radius using furthest border point from center.

For bullet collision detection, test each bullet border:  is it inside
the enemy's radius?


Always slant things in favor of player:
Example:
--Enemy radius computed using furthest point from center
--Player ship radius computed using closest point to center


Noticing that there are gaps in the polygon meshes at various
blend points...  This is because the current designs have
polygon vertices that merely "line up" with the edge of another
polygon (instead of sharing a vertex with that polygon).

For proper blending, polygons that share and edge must share
both vertices....  i.e., we must have a true triangle mesh.


Next:
--Fix enemy and explosion meshes (start over?)
--Work on bullet collisions


June 21, 2004

Got bullet collisions working.
Added enemy bullets and impacts on ship.

Still need to check for memory leaks.

Fixed several memory leaks.


Got enemies to attack sculpture.
(This makes it very hard).

Checked for leaks.






August 6, 2004

Parameterized sound samples.

Each control point has:

--an anchor in the range [0,1]
--a waveform (a series of wave control points with x values in the 
  range [0,1] and y values in the range [-1,1]).
--a freqency (how many times the waveform plays per second)
--a loudness in the range [0,1]



Ship bullet has two sound param spaces.

Close range space and far range space.

When ship fires, close range and far range params select 2 sound control
points, and these points are blended across the duration of the firing sound.

A PlayableSound implementation can take two SoundParameterSpaceControlPoints
and blend them to generate samples.



In practice, this is too slow, since a separate blend has to be made for
each sound sample.  This cannot be done in realtime on my test machine, and
doing it offline ahead of time (at game startup) is quite slow too, even
for a 1-second sound.  The resulting sound, however, sounds quite nice.

If we do only one blend per buffer of samples requested by the soundcard,
then we can do it in realtime, but there is a "stepping" artifact in the
sound as it changes over time (not a smooth blend, of course).

Whatever we do, it needs to be realtime, since we want the sound to change
according to power-up level (or boss anger level).

Instead of blending per-sample, we will have to generate a single sound
control point based on the current power-up level.  When a bullet is fired,
we can get sound samples from that single control point.  Each sound will be
relatively static sounding (sound won't change character as it plays).
However, sounds can change as power-up status changes.

To make things more interesting, we can add extra features to a single control 
point, like:

--both start and end frequency (linear blend as sound plays) instead of one
  static frequency
--both start and end loudness (linear blend again).

It is possible to pull samples from an interpolated wave table in realtime,
at least for wavetables that have very few control points (in my tests).

Sine tones are nice, though, and accurately representing a sine might take
a lot of control points.  Could use forumlas instead of control-point 
wavetables, but this would make blending control points impossible.

Actually, game sound might be unique if everything was sine-based... 
like my song "a real civilization".  Maybe this will push us away from
control-point wavetables.

Each control point could instead have a set of frequency/amplitude sine 
components, and we could approximate square waves (and others) with appropriate
component sets.  Plus, we could blend component sets quite easily (same 
2-component vector blending code).




August 9, 2004

Got sine component version of SoundParameterSpaceControlPoints working.

Next:
Work on ParameterizedSoundSpace


August 12, 2004

Got ParameterizedStereoSound working.  Checked for memory leaks.


Currently, 3 simultaneous sounds causes skipping.  Halving the sample
rate doubles the number of simultaneous sounds.

Next:  change sound control point so that blocks of samples can be
fetched at one time.


Even with blocks of samples, 3 sounds causes skipping... Time to turn
profiling on...

Noticed a core dump when playing too many sounds at once (5 sounds when
the limit is set to 3... probably a destruction problem)



August 13, 2004

Fixed the core dump by adding mutex to SoundPlayer

Profiling doesn't seem to work right for OpenGL apps...  Fixed a few hot spots.


Can hear a "clicking" sound when sounds are dropped (when too many sounds
are playing).  Maybe we should "fade" a sound out somehow for a few frames
before dropping it.  Maybe flag it to be dropped, then fade it out during
the next buffer requested by the sound card.


August 14, 2004

Added fade-out before drop.

Changed default sample rate to 11025 Hz.  I cannot personnally hear the 
difference (for sine-based tones, there may be very little difference... 
though we should observe the low Nyquist limit here).

Next:

--Add proper parameterized sounds for bullets of ship, enemies, and boss
  (Two parameter spaces that are mapped by the current bullet params and then
   blended to produce the sound control point that is played--- just like for
   bullet graphics, except we don't blend the mapped endpoints in time).
--Start working on music stuff.
--Add extra space for enemy graphics:  should have both "close range space"
  and "far range space".  Enemies should blend between these spaces (using
  inverse exponential?) as they move closer to the ship.



August 15, 2004

Added BulletSound template class to implement proper parameterized sounds
for ship bullets.  Changed ShipBulletManager to use it.  It works.

--Still need to write template files for boss and enemy bullets.



August 16, 2004

Added template files for boss and enemy shot sounds.

Need to add code for templated explosion sounds for both.

Found 4 memory leaks... need to fix them.




August 19, 2004

Fixed the memory leaks.

Bug in moving sculpture piece when ship hits area boundary.
Fixed this bug.


Added boss and enemy explosion sounds... problem in that boss explosion sound
is overridden by multiple ship shots...  Fix:  flag certain sounds as priority
sounds...  non-priority sounds are killed before priority sounds when too
many sounds are playing.


Need to check for memory leaks.

Also... "close" and "far" parameters for the BulletSound class are misused
when applied to boss explosion sounds.  Could be confusing for other 
programmers.  Should change to a more generic 2-parameter class 
(A and B params, maybe).





August 20, 2004

Added priority flags for sounds so that boss explosion is not cut off by 
additional sounds

Checked for memory leaks.


How is music going to work?

Cannot use arbitrary control-point spaces for notes because we want the music
to be (potentially) very dense, and the sound player cannot play that many
control-point notes at the same time.

For the current sample rate, we need to generate an array of wavetables, one
for each of the various pitch/length combinations, and have these ready
in memory.

Notes must either linearly fade-out or fade-in (fade-in accomplished [without 
clicks!] by reading the wavetable backwards). 

The wavetables are indexed by 2 parameters:
--the pitch index in range [0, numPitches) 
--the length index in range [0, numLengths) 

The wavetable class can map these 2 parameters to a SoundSamples object.



Each sculpture piece generates its music part when it is constructed.  A part
consists of a list of notes.  Each note has a pitch index, a length index, and
a reversal flag (to fade note in instead of out).  The piece also picks
an overall length for its part, and the note lengths must add up to a value
less than or equal to the overall length.


Files controling music:

--"musicNotePitches"  -- contains a list of pitches, in hertz, that notes can
  play at  (for example:   400  200  800 )
--"musicNoteLengths"  -- contains a list of lengths in seconds for notes
  (for example:  1  2  .5  .25 )
--"musicChanceReversedNote"  -- contains a single floating point value 
  indicating the probability of a given note should be played in reverse.
--"musicPartLength"  -- contains the length in seconds for music parts
  (for example:  5 )


Music player treats each horizontal grid line as a sequence of parts.  The
sequence is assigned a stereo position based on the grid line's vertical
position.

Parts are played as if a time marker was sweeping across the grid from
left to right, starting at the left-most in-sculpture piece, and wrapping
back around once the right-most sculpture piece has been played.  Thus,
gaps between pieces in the horizontal direction result in silent sections
of the music (though there are not silent gaps at the beginning or end
resulting from in-sculpture pieces not touching the edge of the grid---
overal looping song length is determined by the width of the sculpture). 

Thus, since the ship drops pieces on grid points, constructed songs will
sound clean and regemented.  However, as enemies knock pieces off of these
grid points, songs will start to "degenerate" as parts fall out of time
with eachother.


Music player tracks current horizontal position, wrapping back to far-left
sculpture piece when far-right has been reached.  Position tracked in seconds.

Sculpture pieces can provide samples from a particular time range of their
part.  


Sample generation sequence:

SoundPlayer needs a block of 1000 music samples, so it calls the music player
to get them.

Music player maps current time position into grid...


Actually, cannot generate music samples in realtime as pieces move around,
since this might cause time pointer to jump back in time in a given sculpture's
music part (causing clicks and breaks in the sound).

Instead, need to generate an entire song loop at one time every time we wrap
back around (using the instantaneous sculpture layout)... this would be too
slow, though, since we would be periodically doing a large computation during 
a single graphics frame.  Need to spread calculation out across time during
which the sound will play.  Maybe the music player needs to gather a collection
of notes at once (from instantaneous sculpture layout) and then produce
samples for those notes on SoundPlayer demand.



Maybe music player should maintain a list of active notes that are 
currently playing.

When SoundPlayer asks for 1000 samples, music player maps into grid, then
maps into "currently playing" sculpture pieces and asks them each for notes
that will *start* playing between "now" and 1000 samples from now.  These
notes are added to the music player's list of actives.

These notes can be rendered (using wavetables) to stereo-shifted samples when 
they are added to the actives list, including silent samples at the 
beginning to represent the fact that a note isn't playing yet

Each note has:
--A stereo sample buffer
--A current position in the note's sample buffer

Then, to generate 1000 samples, the music player walks through the active
notes and adds the relevant samples to the 1000-sample
buffer and updates each note's current position.  Notes that are used up 
are dropped from the active list.

As sculpture pieces move around, the music sound will remain consistent
(will not jump backwards in individual note wavetables).


Current grid horizontal music time position shown by highlighting the
appropriate vertical grid line.  



August 22, 2004

Wrote wave table mapping class.

Started work on interface for MusicPlayer.


Need a MusicPart class (one instance for each sculpture piece).

Features:
-- Constructor that, given music parameters, will generate its own notes
-- getNotesStartingInInterval function

int (numNotes) getNotesStartingInInterval( 
    double inStartTimeInSeconds, 
    double inLengthInSeconds,
    int **outNotePitchIndices,
    int **outNoteLengthIndices,
    double **outNoteStartOffsetsInSeconds );



To generate samples, MusicPlayer will compare its current grid posistion
against the position of each in-sculpture piece.  If the grid position falls
inside a piece's part, the Player will map the grid position to an in-part
time (e.g., into the range [0,5] if parts are 5 seconds long) and then
ask the sculpture piece for notes that start in that range (by calling
getNotesStartingInInterval for the piece's MusicPart).

Each note obtained in this way is rendered to a SoundSamples object using 
--the MusicNoteWaveTable,
--the stereo position of the sculpture piece, and 
--the note's start offset.  
The SoundSamples object is added to the list of active notes.




Got music working...  it sounds pretty cool.


August 23, 2004

Still a few more tweaks:

X-More testing... notes sound like they are overlapping, even when
  only one sculpture piece is playing.
X-Check for leaks.
X-Set note stereo position based on vertical piece position.
X-Show highlight line on grid as current play position.


Sounds very nice... cursor looks good


August 24, 2004

Next:
--Add extra space for enemy graphics:  should have both "close range space"
  and "far range space".  Enemies should blend between these spaces (using
  inverse exponential?) as they move closer to the ship.


Added code for this, and modified the level files a bit to test it...
Seems to work.
Need to write control point editor to speed up the modification process and 
test it further.

Need to tweak the inverse exponential formula so that enemies warp at a good
rate as they approach the ship.

Also checked for leaks.


Next:
ObjectParameterSpaceControlPoint editor.




August 27, 2004

Got all editor features working.

Trying to compile/run on Mac.

Opening the SoundPlayer causes the mac environment to reset the CWD...

Need to set the CWD *after* opening the sound player, perhaps... need to
pass the path into the GameSceneHandler constructor, or make it a global.




August 30, 2004

Optimization:
Avoided blending whenever possible (at either end of parameter ranges).
With 10 enemies, this brought a 3 frame/second increase in performance
(9 FPS before opt, 11.8 FPS after opt).



September 26, 2004

Fixed the X86 makefile (missing portaudio).  Need a new release here.

0.1.2

Mac filename is too long for Mac IE (truncating .dmg extension to .dm, which
makes the file un-clickable on the desktop).

Should shorten the file name.

Should add a link to the GLUT source code for linux users.
http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glut-3.7.tar.gz


Suggestions from happypenguin.org users:

"Although it's quite theraputic as it stands, I think it needs a bit more 
purpose, stuff like time limits for completing a level, maybe make the 
playfield bigger as you go (so your ship has to go further to fetch glyphs), 
and the nasties tougher (with a few glyphs near the center, one shot generally
deep-sixes a nasty), extra guru points for forming specific patterns and so 
on."




September 29, 2004

Feedback from wavexx @ sourceforge

"Speaking of the windows build 1.1; when you're about to place all the
glyphs, the controls seems to become very difficult and unresponsive
(the frame-rate isn't affected though), like having a "stuck" key.

When fading to the next level, the boss is re-shown in full opacity for
an instant.

If you get hit, you move to the centre. I suspect this is too
easy... It's an easy tactic to get at the centre to fight for the minor
anti-glyphs, and it's also a good point to move to the mayor anti-glyph.

Also, linking with -mwindows under mingw will eliminate the unused dos
box :)"



Ideas:

--When you get all Elements in your collage, your bullets should gain
  a special ability, like heat-seeking and extra-long distance.

--Limit the number of ship bullets on the screen at one time.
  (to make space-bar mashing ineffective)

--Zoom way out while fading out and zoom in when fading back in.

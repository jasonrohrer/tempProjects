Seems like 7 bounces and 15 limit on retries are best for this method.

Trying a Tabu-based search as alternative.



Got Tabu, with full rescramble after too many failed tries,
working for a great improvement:


300 runs:

Best-first bounce average time = 0.566607, worst time = 3.804000

That's 6x faster.

Yes, 30 is the best average time, but look at the worst time...  hmm...


1000 limit / -1 scramble average time = 0.088317, worst time = 0.862000
1000 limit / 30 scramble average time = 0.073527, worst time = 0.621000

1000 limit / 36 scramble average time = 0.084190, worst time = 0.733000

I think we're just up against a peculiarity in the seed.

Switching to r + 303 as the seed

1000 limit / -1 scramble average time = 0.091240, worst time = 0.876000
1000 limit / 34 scramble average time = 0.083483, worst time = 0.437000
1000 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.080267, worst time = 0.504000
1000 limit / 36 scramble average time = 0.088560, worst time = 0.748000


Okay, 1000, -1 still the best.



Doing a run of 1000:

990 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.086504, worst time = 0.582000
1000 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.088482, worst time = 0.745000
1100 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.086144, worst time = 0.526000


Back to 300 run:

1000 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.079310, worst time = 0.499000
1100 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.094103, worst time = 0.529000
1200 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.084810, worst time = 0.550000

Okay, so it's a toss-up.  1000 good enough.


Big run of 3000:

1000 limit / 35 scramble average time = 0.088313, worst time = 0.907000


Searching for range of tie fractions.

Run of 300:
Lowest tie fraction = 1.194444%, higest tie fraction = 1.819444%


Run of 3000:
Lowest tie fraction = 1.194444%, higest tie fraction = 1.819444%


Seems like ties are always pretty rare (1-2%) and never common,
and never totally absent.

Not at all clear that there is such a huge difference, or that picking a
"worse" move, from a greedy perspective, will result in four more points
later on.  A sign that deeply skillful play is possible.


Me vs AI, me as P1 playing greedy:

Player moves:  1    2
               3    1
               2    0
               1    5
               4    3
               0    2
               5    4
Final minmax score = -43
Final score = P1: 36   P2: 79

AI creams me even worse than it beats min-max as p1.  So, min-max
performs better than greedy for either p1 or p2.  Good stuff.


Got auto-greedy player working that matches my scores as acheived
by my manual greedy play.
